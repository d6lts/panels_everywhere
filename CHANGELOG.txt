--------------------------------------------
Initial commit to CVS
#674222: README.txt missed "engine = phptemplate" line for the blank.info --
  this is needed so the blank theme can have templates.
Make sure that page manager edit screens are NOT run through layouts in case of
  catastrophic configuration of the site_template.
#679206: Using the setting to hide Drupal blocks/regions would cause
  theme('page') to loop infinitely resulting in either bad HTML or whitescreens.
Add some descriptive info text to the content types we offer to help introduce
  people to what will be IN the content and how they can theme them.
Update the README to include instructions on setting the page title to set from
  the page content pane.
Breadcrumb did not display properly in pane navigation due to error in
  theme.inc.
#679252: Create a sample variant and include it with Panels Everywhere, with an
  easy setting to make it go away after it is no longer needed.
