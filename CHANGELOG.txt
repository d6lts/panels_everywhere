Changelog for Panels Everywhere

Panels Everywhere 1.x-dev
  o Initial commit to CVS
  o #674222: README.txt missed "engine = phptemplate" line for the blank.info -- this is needed so the blank theme can have templates.
  o Make sure that page manager edit screens are NOT run through layouts in case of catastrophic configuration of the site_template.
